# DTDL Property Widget [dtdl.property]

This widget allows to load DTDL models (Digital Twin Definition Language) and use them as native USD attributes for Prims. Properties are saved as raw USD attributes.

Note: Currently only properties with primitive schemas are supported. Relationships, Enums, ... will be added in the future.
